                <p>
                    Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are
                    similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left , moving elements up and
                    down or left and right along the x and y axes. When you employ a translation function, youâ€™re moving
                    elements without impacting the flow of the document. Unlike position: relative , which allows you to
                    position an element either against its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a
                    translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.

                    <p>Transforms require vendor prefixing for IE9, Android up to 4.4.3, iOS8, and Blackberry 10. To
                        make the aforementioned code work in IE9 and older mobile WebKit browsers, you would include the
                        following:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="transform">
                    <h1>Put your <span>dukes</span> up, sire</h1>
